  <h2>A Kotlin Symbol Processor to generate Compose PreviewParameterProviders</h2>

</div>


<details>
  <summary><h3>1. What are PreviewParameterProviders to begin with?<h3/></summary>

In [`Jetpack Compose`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), we use something called [`Previews`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tooling), which are `Composable` functions written specifically to preview (or interact with) the UI rendered by `Compose` in the editor itself without needing to run the app on a device.

And `Composable` methods generally have some parameters based on which the UI is rendered. More often than not, `Composable` methods have a significant amount of data inputs which are needed to be passed from the preview methods for the previews to render.

In cases like these [`PreviewParameterProvider`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/tooling/preview/PreviewParameterProvider) (a class from the Compose tooling library) can be used to provide data for the previews.

`PreviewParameterProvider` makes the `Preview` methods less verbose and easy to read by abstracting away the input data construction logic. And these providers can be reused across various `Preview` methods to render different previews.

</details>

## 2. Why Dowel?

Due to the amount of sheer verbosity involved in writing `PreviewParameterProvider` *by hand*, it becomes tedious to write `PreviewParameterProvider` for each and every UI model. And as writing `PreviewParameterProvider` for every model becomes an uninteresting task it becomes a barrier to entry for writing `Previews` for all the `Composables`.

#### That is where `Dowel` comes in and takes care of generating all of the boilerplate `PreviewParameterProvider` logic for your UI models.

This makes writing `Previews` simple and hence encourages writing more `Previews` for `Composables` in general. Apart from that, with `Dowel` you can also *`Fuzz test`* your `Composables` with all of the random values of random length or range being generated for all of the properties of the inputs. 

> **Note** : These random lengths or ranges can also be regulated, read more at *"4. How do I use Dowel?"* section.

## 3. Gradle setup

#### 3.1. Add KSP plugin to your **module's** `build.gradle` file
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "1.7.0-1.0.6"
}
```
> **Note** : Make sure your project's `Kotlin` version and `KSP version` are the same. Learn more about the available versions [here](https://github.com/google/ksp/releases)

#### 3.2. Add `jitpack.io` to the `repositories` blocks in your project's `settings.gradle` file
```gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // Other repos
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // <----- This is the line to add
    }
}
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        // Other repos
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // <----- This is the line to add
    }
}
```

#### 3.3. Add the `Dowel` dependencies in your **module's** `build.gradle` file
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.jayasuryat.dowel:dowel:<version>")
    ksp("com.github.jayasuryat.dowel:dowel-processor:<version>")
}
```

#### 3.4. Add `KSP` generated files as sources in your **module's** `build.gradle` file
```gradle
kotlin {
    sourceSets.configureEach {
        kotlin.srcDir("$buildDir/generated/ksp/$name/kotlin/")
    }
}
```

## 4. How?
`Dowel` uses [`Kotlin Symbol Processing API`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html) under the hood to read, parse, and process source code to generate appropriate `PreviewParameterProviders`.

The primary entry point into `Dowel` is with [`@Dowel`](https://github.com/JayaSuryaT/Dowel/blob/main/dowel-annotation/src/main/java/com/jayasuryat/dowel/annotation/Dowel.kt) annotation.

`Dowel` goes through all the classes annotated with `@Dowel` annotation and generates `PreviewParameterProvider` for each class.

### For example

```kotlin
// File : NewsArticle.kt
import androidx.compose.runtime.State
import com.jayasuryat.dowel.annotation.Dowel
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow

@Dowel(count = 2)
data class NewsArticle(
    val title: String,
    val description: String,
    val likes: Int,
    val authors: List<String>,
    val liveComments: Flow<List<String>>,
    val isExpanded: State<Boolean>,
    val status: Status,
    val onArticleClicked: () -> Unit,
) {

    enum class Status { Draft, Accepted, Posted }
}
```

### Generates ðŸ‘‡

```kotlin
// File in generated sources : NewsArticlePreviewParamProvider.kt
package com.yourapp.module

import androidx.compose.runtime.mutableStateOf
import androidx.compose.ui.tooling.preview.PreviewParameterProvider
import kotlin.sequences.Sequence
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.flowOf

public class NewsArticlePreviewParamProvider : PreviewParameterProvider<NewsArticle> {
  public override val values: Sequence<NewsArticle> = sequenceOf(
    NewsArticle(
      title = "AdipiscingDuis ac porttitor et",
      description = "Phasellusmassa suscipit iaculi",
      likes = 94,
      authors = listOf(
        "Velamet ultricies malesuada co",
        "Consequatmassa malesuada sapie",
        "Ameta et at bibendum ut neque ",
        "Mimollis ac consectetur Praese",
        "Namimperdiet massa bibendum po",
      ),
      liveComments = flowOf(listOf(
        "Malesuadasit Duis dapibus cong",
        "Metusluctus nec congue congue ",
        "InPraesent est tempus ac ultri",
        "Malesuadaquis est Lorem sapien",
        "FinibusCras mattis imperdiet n",
      )),
      isExpanded = mutableStateOf(false),
      status = NewsArticle.Status.values().random(),
      onArticleClicked = {},
    ),
    NewsArticle(
      title = "Tempuspurus congue elit euismo",
      description = "Conguemetus Duis enim tincidun",
      likes = 3,
      authors = listOf(
        "Namcondimentum lobortis et ali",
        "Congueeu ultrices lacinia sed ",
        "Lectussuscipit nisi eu quis se",
        "Utnisi sapien mi ex magna magn",
        "Proinipsum malesuada enim sed ",
      ),
      liveComments = flowOf(listOf(
        "CongueProin nec metus metus ma",
        "Antenisi consectetur ac purus ",
        "Eualiquet malesuada turpis rho",
        "LobortisDuis mollis ac a lacus",
        "Magnaet Donec libero Lorem sap",
      )),
      isExpanded = mutableStateOf(false),
      status = NewsArticle.Status.values().random(),
      onArticleClicked = {},
    ),
  )

}

```

## 5. How do I use `Dowel`?
There are only 3 `Dowel` annotations you need to know about:
1. [`@Dowel`](https://github.com/JayaSuryaT/Dowel/blob/main/dowel-annotation/src/main/java/com/jayasuryat/dowel/annotation/Dowel.kt) : The primary entry point into `Dowel`, triggeres generation `PreviewParameterProvider` for that class.
2. [`@DowelList`](https://github.com/JayaSuryaT/Dowel/blob/main/dowel-annotation/src/main/java/com/jayasuryat/dowel/annotation/DowelList.kt) : Same as `@Dowel`, but generates a `PreviewParameterProvider` of type `List<T>` where `T` is the class annotated with `@DowelList` annotation. Rest of the behavior is same as the `@Dowel` annotation.
3. [`@ConsiderForDowel`](https://github.com/JayaSuryaT/Dowel/blob/main/dowel-annotation/src/main/java/com/jayasuryat/dowel/annotation/ConsiderForDowel.kt) : If you want to add support for an unsupported type, or override provider logic for a particular type, then you can do that with `@ConsiderForDowel` annotation.

Apart from that if you want to controll range / legnth / size of the values being generated, you can do that with `androidx.annotations`. Currently these 3 are the only supported ones:
* `androidx.annotation.IntRange` : Control the range of `Int` and `Long` properties
* `androidx.annotation.FloatRange` : Control the range of `Float` and `Double` properties
* `androidx.annotation.Size` : Control the size of `String`, `List` and `Map` properties


## 6. What all is possible?
`Dowel` is quite flexible with the types it already supports, but there are certain limits on what all types are supported, and in general how `Dowel` works :

- Classes annotated with any of the `Dowel` annotations (`@Dowel`, `@DowelList` or `@ConsdierForDowel`) should be concrete (non-abstract)
- Primary constructors of classes annotated with any of the `Dowel` annotations should not be private
- Only classes extending `androidx.compose.ui.tooling.preview.PreviewParameterProvider` can be annotated with `@ConsiderForDowel`
- Only classes already annotated with `@Dowel` can be annotated with `@DowelList`
- All of the properties listed in the primary constructor of class annotated with `@Dowel` can only be of the following types:
  - Primitives (`Int`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Char`, `Boolean`, `String`)
  - `androidx.compose.runtime.State`
  - `kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow`
  - Functional types (high-order functions, lambdas)
  - `@Dowel` classes (`@Dowel` classes can be nested. A `@Dowel` annotated class can have properties of the type of classes which are again annotated with `@Dowel`)
  - Types for which a user-defined `PreviewParameterProvider` exist (via the `@ConsiderForDowel` annotation)
  - `Sealed` types
  - Kotlin Objects
  - `Enum`
  - `List`
  - `Map`
  - `Pair`
  - Properties with **unsupported** types which are nullable are allowed, and the generated value would always be null
  - Properties with default values can have *any type*, as they are not considered while generating code
  - Types in the above mentioned list having generic type parameters (like `List` and `Map`) can only have `@Dowel` supported types as their type parameters. Like `List<String>`, `Map<String, @Dowel class>`
- As far as a type is in above mentioned supported list, there are no practical limitations on how many times they may be nested.
Like `List<Map<String, List<@Dowel class>>>`

## `Dowel` ships with `lint` rules
`Dowel` ships with `lint` rules which cover all of the basic scenarios and will warn you even before you might compile the code.

And for the things that `lint` doesn't catch, like issues with unsupported types of properties, meaningful error messages will be logged from KSP to nudge you in the right direction.
